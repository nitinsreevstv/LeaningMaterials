Types of Machine Learning 
- Supervised Learning
- Unsuperwised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning



Supervised learning :- In supervised learning, the machine learning algorithm learn from labelled data.

Types of Supervised Learning
1. Classification
2. Regression


Classification :- Classification is about predicting a class or discrete values.
Example :- Find which one is dog or cat ? Train ML model with the multiple images of Dog and Cat.

Regression :- Regression is about predicting a quantity or continuous values.


Classification Algo :-
1. Decision Tree Classification
2. Random Forest Classification
2. K-nearest Neighbor

Regression Algo:-
1. Logistic Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Support Vector Machines



Unsupervised Learning:- In Unsupervised learning, The ML algorithm learns from unlabbelled data.

Ex :- Multiple data and ML will find the pattern and group them with same property.

Types of Unsupervised Learning:-
1. Clustering :- Clustering is an Unsupervised task which involves grouping the similar data points.

2. Association :- Association is an unsupervised task that is used to find important relationship between data points.


Algorithm for unsupervised learning:- 
1. K-means Clustering
2. Heirarchical Clustering
3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
4. Apriori
5. Eclat
