1. What is LangChain?
- LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs) like GPT. 

Instead of just prompts to an LLM, LangChain helps :- 
- Structure workflows (chain steps together)
- Connect data source (files, databases and APIs)
- Remember context (Memory)
- Call tools (Like Google serch, Calculator or your own function)
- Build agents (AI that decides what action to take next)

2. Why LangChain ?
Without Langchain:
- You'd manually handle prompts, responses, parsing and tools integrations.
With LangChain:
- You get a standaedized way to connecty models, tools and memory.
- You can go from a chatbot -> to a reasoning agent -> to a production app faster.

3. Core Concept in LangChain ?
Here are the building blocks:
- Models - The LLMs (Like OpenAI GPT, Anthropic, LLaMA, Local Models)
- Prompts - Templates for structured inputs.
- Chains - Sequence of calls (LLM -> processing -> another LLM)
- Memory - Keep conversation history or context
- Agents - Let the AI decide what tool/action to use
- Tools - Functions/APIs like Google search, math or DB queries.
- Retrieval - Pull data from vector databases (RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
